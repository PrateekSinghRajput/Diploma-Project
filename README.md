# Automatic Garbage Level Detection and Smart Waste Management System

## Project Overview

This project presents a novel concept for smart waste management and disposal using embedded systems technologies including GSM, GPS, RF communication, AVR microcontroller, and Embedded C programming. The system automatically detects the garbage level in dustbins installed in a smart home environment using ultrasonic sensors. It provides real-time information about the dustbin status to relevant authorities and stakeholders to optimize waste collection and management.

When a garbage container is full, the system automatically sends an alert message via GSM to the society owner and municipal office. Additionally, the garbage level and status are monitored in real-time using RF transmitter and receiver modules, enabling efficient and timely waste disposal.

## System Architecture

### 1. Garbage Level Detection

- Ultrasonic sensors measure the distance from the sensor to the garbage surface.
- When the garbage level crosses a predefined threshold (indicating a full dustbin), the system triggers an alert.

### 2. Wireless Monitoring

- RF transmitter attached to the dustbin node sends real-time garbage level data wirelessly.
- RF receiver at the monitoring station receives and displays dustbin status.

### 3. Alert Notification

- Upon detecting a full dustbin, the AVR microcontroller activates the GSM module.
- GSM module sends an SMS alert to the society owner and municipal office containing dustbin status and location (if GPS integrated).
