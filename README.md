# ♻️ Automatic Garbage Level Detection and Smart Waste Management System 🚮

## 📋 Project Overview

This project presents a novel concept for **smart waste management** using embedded systems technologies including **GSM, GPS, RF communication, AVR microcontroller**, and **Embedded C** programming. The system automatically detects the garbage level in dustbins installed in a smart home environment using **ultrasonic sensors**. It provides **real-time information** about dustbin status to relevant authorities to optimize waste collection and management.

When a garbage container is full, the system automatically sends an alert message via 📱 **GSM** to the society owner and municipal office. Additionally, the garbage level and status are monitored in real-time using 📡 **RF transmitter and receiver** modules, enabling efficient and timely waste disposal.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 1. Garbage Level Detection

- Ultrasonic sensors measure the distance from the sensor to the garbage surface.
- When the garbage level crosses a predefined threshold (indicating a full dustbin), the system triggers an alert.

### 2. Wireless Monitoring

- RF transmitter attached to the dustbin node sends real-time garbage level data wirelessly.
- RF receiver at the monitoring station receives and displays dustbin status.

### 3. Alert Notification

- Upon detecting a full dustbin, the AVR microcontroller activates the GSM module.
- GSM module sends an SMS alert to the society owner and municipal office containing dustbin status and location (if GPS integrated).
